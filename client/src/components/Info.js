            <h2> Resources for Russian Lacquer Art</h2><br/>

            <p><span>Russian lacquer art developed from the art of icon painting, which came to an end with the collapse of 
                Imperial Russia. The icon painters, who previously had been employed by supplying not only churches but 
                people's homes, needed a way to make a living. Thus, the craft of making papier-mâché decorative boxes and 
                panels developed, the items were lacquered and then hand painted by the artists, often with scenes from 
                folk tales.</span></p>
